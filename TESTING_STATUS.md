# MuMDIA Testing Framework - Final Status Report

## 🎯 Summary

I've successfully created a comprehensive testing framework for your MuMDIA proteomics pipeline. The framework is **partially functional** with excellent coverage for core components.

## ✅ What's Working (21 Tests Passing)

### Data Structures (15/15 tests passing) - 100% Coverage
- **`CorrelationResults`** dataclass validation
- **`PickleConfig`** serialization configuration  
- **`SpectraData`** MS2 spectra data structures
- Field validation, type checking, and constraints
- Serialization/deserialization workflows

### Correlation Functions (6/6 tests passing) - 28% Coverage
- **`corrcoef_ignore_both_missing`** - Correlation ignoring NaN values
- **`corrcoef_ignore_zeros`** - Correlation ignoring zero values  
- **`cosine_similarity`** - Vector similarity calculations
- Edge case handling (orthogonal vectors, zero norms)
- Mathematical accuracy validation

### Testing Infrastructure
- **pytest configuration** with proper markers and filters
- **Test fixtures** for realistic proteomics data
- **Coverage reporting** with HTML output
- **Test runner script** with category selection
- **Makefile** for easy development workflow

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Fragment Intensity Tests (11/19 tests failing)
- **Numba compilation errors**: JIT compilation issues with complex correlation matrices
- **Missing dependencies**: `rustyms` library not installed
- **Rich logging issues**: Version compatibility problems

### Utility Tests (2/18 tests failing) 
- **Polars edge cases**: Empty dataframe handling with numeric operations
- **Mock assertion counts**: Minor test assertion issues

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Install rustyms dependency**:
   ```bash
   pip install rustyms
   ```

2. **Update Rich library** (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade rich
   ```

3. **Consider Numba alternatives** for testing complex correlation functions

## 📊 Coverage Analysis

- **Data Structures**: 100% coverage (35/35 statements)
- **Fragment Intensity**: 28% coverage (59/207 statements) 
- **Overall**: 38.8% coverage on tested modules

The lower coverage on fragment intensity is expected since many functions require full integration with rustyms and Numba-compiled code.

## 🚀 How to Use the Framework

### Run Working Tests
```bash
# All working tests
python -m pytest tests/test_data_structures.py tests/test_features_fragment_intensity.py::TestCorrelationFunctions -v

# Data structures only
python tests/run_tests.py data

# With coverage report
make coverage
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
make dev-setup      # Install dependencies
make test          # Run all tests  
make format        # Format code
make lint          # Check code quality
make clean         # Clean artifacts
```
